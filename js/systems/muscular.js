    const soleuspanel = createPanel("soleuspanel", "Soleus Information", "soleusclose", "Function: This muscle plantar flexes the foot.\nEvolutionary Perspective: The soleus works with the gastrocnemius to provide the powerful push-off needed for walking and running. Its development is critical for endurance and stability in bipedal locomotion. The soleus is particularly important for maintaining posture and preventing fatigue during prolonged standing and movement.");
    
    const tibialispanel = createPanel("tibialispanel", "Tibialis Anterior Information", "tibialisclose", "Function: This muscle dorsiflexes the foot and inverts the foot.\nEvolutionary Perspective: The tibialis anterior is crucial for walking and running, allowing the foot to clear the ground during the swing phase of gait. In early hominins, the development of this muscle helped improve efficiency in bipedal locomotion, reducing the energy cost of walking and running.");
