Early vertebrates had simple skull structures, but as organisms evolved, the skull became more complex to accommodate larger brains, sensory organs, and features necessary for eating. The skull also evolved to support complex speech and facial expressions. This is why prior species in the homo genus often have smaller skulls.");

A 2020 study suggests that ribs were evolved to assist with locomotion when reptiles first emerged from the water, which were then later adapted for breathing");
